For the Final Problem Set: 
This final problem set covers all concepts covered over the past dozen weeks. The problems are significantly more difficult than anything you've encountered so far: we expect some of the problems may take multiple hours to solve.

Despite that, all these problems can be solved with only the concepts you've learned so far in this class. You'll apply them in new ways, come to clever new tricks for how to integrate them, and wrestle with more complicated combinations, but nothing here requires anything that you haven't learned already. Although many of them will benefit from the algorithmic and object-oriented thinking you've been developing more recently, they can all also be solved only with earlier topics.

The other purpose of this final problem set is to expose you to a breadth of topics in computing. You'll have problems on artificial intelligence, including writing a basic plagiarism detector and programming a Blackjack bot. You'll have problems on data analytics, including exploring data sets from Georgia Tech football, the United States Social Security Administration, and Pokemon. You'll close with a problem from cybersecurity, programming the Playfair cipher, one of the early encryption methods. We hope these problems spark your interest in what you might want to do in the future.

And don't fret: the problems on the final exam are significantly easier. The exam is designed to be completed in a single, two-hour sitting; the problems in this problem set are designed to bounce around in your head for a few days until the answer dawns on you in the middle of the night.

Note that the fill-in-the-blank problems do not have any kind of time throttle on them: the answer spaces are too large for us to worry about someone brute-force guessing the answer!

For Final Problems 7-9:
Most of our course, we've focused on writing general functions that transform some input into some output. Sometimes, though, we're not interested in writing such general functions: we're interested in answering specific questions that are hard to answer by hand. Coding like this is more like data analysis.

For the next three questions, instead of asking you to write code that accomplishes a certain goal, we're going to ask you to answer specific questions. These questions can only be answered by writing code to explore a particular dataset. Generally, you'll write code that generates an answer for you to read, and then you'll just copy the answer into the problems below.
