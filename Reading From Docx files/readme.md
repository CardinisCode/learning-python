# Reading from Docx Files - Readme

In this directory, I've played around with the idea of writing to docx files & exploring some of the features python-docx has to offer. I also play around with different ways to write to the file & to add new lines. 

To take things a little further, in the file write_word_docs_using_classes.py, I played around with both classes & user input, & then wrote the user input to a docx file. When running this file from the command-line, the user completes a form directly on the command line, & then the program creates a Cover letter docx file. 

I wanted to see if I could create a program which could quickly put together a cover letter from the commandline itself. I do hope I can incorporate this functionality into a Python-Flask web application at some point.
