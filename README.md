# learning-python
 All these code challenges are part of the edX course I'm working through: 
 "Computing in Python: Data Structures - Starting from 
        Section: Dictionaries. 
This includes the code challenges I complete as I complete my python learning as well as random tests and playing with code. 

Some sections may require some explaination so I have included some Markdown documents for this purpose
